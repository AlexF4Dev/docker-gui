# This script uses the simple approach of sharing the host's X11 socket with
# the container. This method requires the container and display to be on the
# same host, but gives performance that is equivalent to running the application
# directly (i.e. not in a container) on the host.
# This script creates an additional .Xauthority file based on the user's but
# with a wildcard hostname to avoid having to set the container's hostname.
