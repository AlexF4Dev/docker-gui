# Run xeyes in a container.
# This image uses the simple approach of sharing the host's X11 socket with
# the container. This method requires the container, GPU device and
# display to be on the same host, but gives performance that is equivalent to
# running the application directly (i.e. not in a container) on the host.

FROM debian:stretch-slim

# Install xeyes
RUN apt-get update && \
    # Add the packages used
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
	x11-apps && \
	rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENTRYPOINT ["xeyes"]

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example usage
# 
# Build the image
# docker build -t xeyes .
#
# To run:
#
# xhost +local:root # Add local:root to the X Server access list.
# docker run --rm \
#     -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY \
#     -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
#     xeyes
# xhost -local:root # Remove local:root to the X Server access list.
