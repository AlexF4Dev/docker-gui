This book provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to packaging and running GUI applications as Docker containers.

The book sets the scene with some simple and well-known X11 applications hosted locally, before tackling more advanced topics such as enabling GPU acceleration in containers to support OpenGL, CUDA and OpenCL applications.

The book also covers several less-frequently discussed topics such as remote accelerated rendering via VirtualGL to enable Cloud hosting of high-end GUI applications, D-bus integration, AppArmor, Bluetooth, realtime scheduling, and running full 3D accelerated virtual desktops in containers.
